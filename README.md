#### This was made when I was first learning Haskell and prior to me knowing how to use Cabal. This code is very old and unfinished, where a new system is using unbxed arrays and vectors for llvm compiling, that I wanted to share. Some of the code in this repository is unfinished. This was before the LLM craze where things have now changed. This was building into an attempt towards "permutative-based ai" wherw I create a special encoding for underlying layers of the net to self-train on the fly.

### Code is now moved into a new repo using unboxed arrays and vectors for when I want to tinker with the underlying math of nets and ai (in haskell, as it is my favorite for math).# AczAIUnfinished
